## Assignment 1: Algorithm Complexity and Empirical Analysis

The primary objective of this assignment is to demonstrate the relationship between the running time of algorithms and their theoretical asymptotic complexities. The following algorithms were implemented and tested:

- **Insertion Sort**
- **Merge Sort**
- **Counting Sort**
- **Linear Search**
- **Binary Search**

### Key Concepts:

## Assignment 2: Dynamic Programming and Greedy Algorithms

This assignment focuses on implementing key algorithms using dynamic programming and greedy approaches. The primary objective is to understand the difference between these two algorithmic paradigms and when to use them.

### Key Concepts:
- **Dynamic Programming**: Breaking down complex problems into simpler subproblems and solving them efficiently.
- **Greedy Algorithms**: Making locally optimal choices with the hope of finding a global optimum.
- **Optimization Problems**: Practical examples and exercises designed to test the application of these methods in real-world problems.

## Assignment 3: Graphs, Connected Components, and Minimum Spanning Trees

In this assignment, the focus is on fundamental graph algorithms. The implemented algorithms deal with:

- **Graph Traversals**: Using DFS and BFS for exploring graphs.
- **Connected Components**: Finding the connected components in a graph.
- **Minimum Spanning Trees (MST)**: Implementing MST algorithms such as Kruskal's and Prim's algorithms.

### Key Concepts:
- **Graph Theory**: Representing and working with graphs using adjacency lists and matrices.
- **Connected Components**: Identifying different connected components in undirected graphs.
- **MST**: Efficiently finding the minimum spanning tree for a weighted graph.

## Assignment 4: Topological Sort, Shortest Path, and Regular Expressions

The final assignment focuses on advanced graph algorithms and introduces the concept of regular expressions.

### Key Concepts:
- **Topological Sorting**: Ordering the vertices of a directed graph such that for every directed edge UV, vertex U comes before V.
- **Shortest Path Algorithms**: Implementing algorithms like Dijkstra's and Bellman-Ford to find the shortest paths in weighted graphs.
- **Regular Expressions**: Basic concepts and applications of regular expressions in pattern matching.
